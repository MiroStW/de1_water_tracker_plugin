# de1-water-tracker-plugin
A plugin for the Decent Espresso DE1 machine that tracks water and filter replacement date

Basically you should be entering a date in the settings to track your filter.
You can also hit the reset button and will auto populate with todays date. 

To-do:
 - Add a ping to let you know when a set total L/gal has been reached for filter change
 - Add a 2 months, 3 months, 6 months, and year selection for time based notifs

Thank you Damian for some sanity checks and question answering.
