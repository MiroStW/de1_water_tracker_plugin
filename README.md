# de1-water-tracker-plugin
A plugin for the Decent Espresso DE1 machine that tracks water and filter replacement date

Basically you should be entering a date in the settings to track your filter.
You can also hit the reset button and will auto populate with todays date.

## Features
- Track total water usage in liters or gallons
- Set a filter change date
- **Get notified when you reach a water usage threshold** - Set your desired threshold in the plugin settings and you'll receive a popup reminder when it's time to change your filter
- Reset counter when you change your filter

## Usage
1. Set your preferred units (L or gallons)
2. Enter the date you last changed your filter
3. Set a filter change reminder threshold (e.g., 100L or 26gal)
4. The plugin will track your water usage and notify you when the threshold is reached
5. When you change your filter, hit "Reset Counter" to start tracking again

To-do:
 - Add a 2 months, 3 months, 6 months, and year selection for time based notifs

Thank you Damian for some sanity checks and question answering.
